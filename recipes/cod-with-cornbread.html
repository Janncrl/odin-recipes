 <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>To make this cod recipe in the oven, start by cooking the cod for 10-15 minutes in boiling water. In the same pan
   or in
   a separate pan, also cook the eggs and the potatoes, peeled and cut into slices, until they are soft but not falling
   apart.</li>
  <li>When the cod is cooked, let it cool slightly and shred it, removing as many bones and skin as you can. Separately,
   crumble the cornbread into a bowl, add 3 chopped garlic cloves and mix.</li>
  <li>Finally, prepare the stir-fry for this cod and cornbread recipe: in a frying pan with olive oil, add the bay
   leaves,
   onions and the remaining sliced or chopped garlic. Leave on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion
   becomes transparent. Turn off the fire.</li>
  <li>To prepare this recipe for cod with shredded cornbread, grease a large baking dish with olive oil and place the
   potatoes
   on top.</li>
  <li>Add the boiled and sliceed eggs and the boiled and shredded cod . Cover everything with the sautéed olive oil,
   onion
   and garlic (discard the bay leaves) and sprinkle the cornbread, to obtain a cornbread crust. Bake at 200ºC for 15-20
   minutes or until the bread is golden.</li>
  <li>After the previous step, your cod with cornbread in the oven is ready to serve. Serve with a salad of your choice
